## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

The **notebooks/** folder contains a Jupyter Notebook used for:

- Understanding data structure and quality
- Checking missing values and distributions
- Initial aggregations and trend checks
- Validating assumptions before dashboard creation

This step ensured that KPIs built later in Power BI were accurate and meaningful.

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

- **Total Revenue**
- **Total Profit**
- **Profit Margin %**
- **Average Order Value**
- **Customer Count**
